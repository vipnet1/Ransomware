Hi,

Your files are encrypted and to unlock them you have to use our decryption service.
You have to transfer 0.1 milli-bitcoins to the address:
bc1qwzyy3z9t062sft9876xx8g885pj3w3npgcwwq67em298fxg0htysu70985

After you done it wait for the blockchain system to approve your transaction(one hour?) and then go to your browser
and go to the url:
http://127.0.0.1:8074/attempt_decrypt/YOUR_TRANSACTION_ID

and your files will be decrypted.

Good luck and have a nice day!!!

*** The actualy encrypted/decrypted files are only those in folder RANSOM ***
