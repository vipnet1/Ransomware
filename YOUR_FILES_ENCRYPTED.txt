Hi,

Your files are encrypted and to unlock them you have to use our decryption service.
You have to transfer 0.1 milli-bitcoins to the address:
bc1qwzyy3z9t062sft9876xx8g885pj3w3npgcwwq67em298fxg0htysu70985

After you done it wait for the blockchain system to approve your transaction(one hour?) and then go to your browser
and go to the url:
http://127.0.0.1:8074/attempt_decrypt/YOUR_TRANSACTION_ID

and your files will be decrypted.

We want to remind you that if you try to remove the ransomware you also will remove the only way of decrypting your files back,
so it's in your interest to keep as alive.

Good luck and have a nice day!!!

*** The actualy encrypted/decrypted files are only those in folder RANSOM ***
